This is simply a fork of a fork of Signal that changes the dark theme to an AMOLED one by using [Molly's colours](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/material3_colors.xml). It's not as complete as it could be, but I guess it's better than nothing ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

For the changes by johan666, see the changes from [their fork](https://github.com/johanw666/Signal-Android/).
