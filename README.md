This is a personal fork of [a fork](https://github.com/johanw666/Signal-Android) of the [Android app for Signal](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android) that themes it with Material You colours on Android 12+, and also replaces some icons with [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com/) ones.

This also acts as a way for me to learn some Android development with an app that I actively use.

## TODO:
- [x] Build and sign an APK
- [ ] Make a Material You version for Light Theme
- [ ] Add some screenshots?

See the original README [here](README%20orig.md).
